{token:[`MIDAS`, `<b>Effect:</b> You transmute yourself into solid stone,
metal, or gemstone. You are immune to all
damage from the triggering action. After the
action resolves, you cease to become a character
and become a height 1 terrain piece. At the start of
your turn, roll a d6. On a 4+, this effect ends and
you become a character again, otherwise you
remain a terrain piece until the end of your turn,
when this effect ends and you turn back into a
character. You can spend 1 Aether to re-roll this
die (you can do this any number of times).
While a terrain piece, youâ€™re immune to all
damage and effects, you are incapacitated, and
you are not targetable by anything that targets
characters. You can still save to end statuses and
this doesn't end any statuses or marks currently
on you.`]}
